Create A market polling bot for TEST.  One that doesn't live solely on google docs.

Plan:

skyvr: Connect to the google APIs, pull from the sheet, and get the following items:
  1. List of items to be monitored, (Pull this every time.) including
      a. Item Name
      b. Item ID
      c. Market Volume Threshold.
      d. Last known market volume
      e. System with market to monitor
  2. SQLite database? List of items recently broadcast with volume at the time. Arch can do this if you don't want to.

arch: Pull the list of data from CREST
  1. Set up a polling scheme every X amount of time.
  2. Maintain the CREST login token in a mostly idle sleeper loop. 
  3. Calculate Current market volume from sell orders.
  4. Pull Weekly Market Volumes in target system.
  5. Output a list/table with 
    a. Name
    b. Market Volume Presently
    c. Weekly Market Volume
    d. b/c*100 (percentage).
    
    
  
Expected Dependencies:
pycrest - CREST library for python
GData - Google docs api for python
numpy - For the array math.

CREST data can be cached to disk or to memory, depending on the needs of the server.
A configuration file will need to be available to set the following values:
  a. Client ID (CREST)
  b. EVE API key (CREST)
  
Conventions:
  Comments on every function describing purpose and return and a summary of inputs.  
  Triple single/double Quote for this.
  One .py module per major function.
  Aim for Python 3.  Well, At least I'd like to, and I know it may not be possible.
  List any additional dependencies in this file.
